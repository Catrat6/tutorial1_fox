## Tutorial One

This is School Work that I am doing form my Web Design class, This class focuses on the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. 

I ended up taking it BC classes where full and I needed another class to be full time and get my full aid, it also DOES count twoard my needed credits so its not exactly a waste although I am sure I know 95% of what will be taught here ... either way though it will be fun to run circles around it and do a nice refresher.
